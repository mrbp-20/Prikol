# Interactive 3D Aquarium - Source Task Specification

This document is the Markdown-converted source specification used as the primary technical assignment for building the aquarium scene.

## Task: Create an Interactive 3D Aquarium Scene

You are an expert frontend and 3D graphics developer.  
Your task is to generate a COMPLETE working web page that renders an interactive 3D aquarium scene which the user can rotate and explore.

---

## Main Goal

Create a **3D scene of an aquarium with highly detailed, animated fish**.

The final result must:
- render in a browser
- be interactive
- allow camera rotation
- contain animated fish swimming inside the aquarium

---

## Technical Requirements

You may use ANY suitable technology, but prefer:
- Three.js (preferred)
- WebGL
- or another browser-native 3D solution

Do NOT use heavy frameworks unless necessary.

The result must be contained in **a single HTML file** with embedded JS and CSS. Since external 3D models (like .obj or .gltf) cannot be easily loaded in a standalone HTML file without CORS issues or massive base64 strings, **you must procedurally generate the highly detailed fish geometry using Three.js primitives, custom BufferGeometries, or compound objects**.

## Scene Requirements

### Aquarium
- Transparent glass aquarium
- Rectangular or rounded tank
- Visible water volume
- Slight refraction or transparency effect
- Subtle lighting and reflections

### Fish (MAXIMUM DETAIL REQUIRED)
- Multiple fish (at least 5) with distinct variations in color, scale, or proportions.
- **Detailed Geometry & Appearance:** Fish must NOT be simple primitives (like basic cones or cubes). Construct them meticulously with distinct body segments, visible moving tails, and fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic). Apply custom shaders or advanced materials to mimic the shiny, iridescent, and smooth nature of fish scales.
- **Advanced Biological Animation:** The movement cannot be rigid. You must implement vertex animation, sine-wave math, or hierarchical object rotation so that the fish's body and tail **undulate naturally** as they swim. The frequency of the tail flap should correlate with their swimming speed.
- **Kinematics & Behavior:**
  - Swim continuously with varying dynamics (e.g., alternating between fast bursts and slow glides).
  - Change direction smoothly, incorporating natural banking/tilting on the roll axis when making sharp turns.
  - Rotate naturally to perfectly face their velocity vector.
  - Implement basic collision avoidance (fish should actively avoid the glass boundaries and ideally each other).
  - Stay strictly inside aquarium bounds.
- Movement must be fully procedural (not static keyframes) and feel biologically alive.

### Environment
- Soft underwater lighting (ambient + directional/point lights)
- Slight blue/aquamarine tint to the water
- Optional bubbles or particles floating upwards

---

## Interaction

User must be able to:
- rotate camera (mouse drag)
- zoom in/out (scroll wheel)
- orbit around aquarium

Use orbit controls or equivalent.

---

## Animation

- Continuous animation loop (`requestAnimationFrame`)
- Smooth FPS
- Fish movement and water/lighting effects must feel alive and dynamic

---

## Code Quality

- Clean readable code
- Comments explaining important parts, especially the math behind the procedural fish geometry and the undulation animation
- No placeholders
- Fully runnable immediately after copy-paste

---

## Output Format

Return ONLY:
1. Complete HTML file
2. No explanations
3. No markdown commentary
4. No extra text

The result must work immediately when opened in a browser.
